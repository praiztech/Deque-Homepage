<h2>Barcelona&apos;s Architect</h2>
<p>As Barcelona's foremost architect, Gaudi's firm devotion to the church made a unique foundation for his thoughts and ideas.
His search for simplicity, based on his careful observations of nature are quite 
apparent in his work, from the Park Guell and its incredible 
sculptures and mosaics, to the church of the Sacred Family 
and its organic bulbous towers.</p>
<h2>Gaudi&apos;s Philosophy</h2>
<p>Gaudi's espousal of a non-conformist philosophy was already visible in his teenage years. This, coupled with his quiet 
but firm devotion to the church, made a unique foundation for his thoughts and ideas.
His search for simplicity, based on his careful observations of nature are quite 
apparent in one of his most profound works, the Park Guell.</p>
