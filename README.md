# Responsive Design & Accessibility

A modern implementation of Deque's website homepage using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I used CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness instead of Tables and Floats used on the original website.

Also, for its accessibility benefits, I revamped the main site navigation from an ARIA menu role to use disclosure widgets instead; and removed the sticky main site navigation.
