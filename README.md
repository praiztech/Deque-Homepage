# Responsive Design & Accessibility

A modern implementation of Deque's website homepage using HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

Converted the site from table and float based styling to use CSS Flexbox and Grid for responsive design.

Also, for its accessibility benefits, revamped the main site navigation from an ARIA menu role to use a disclosure widget instead, and removed main site navigation display on hover.
